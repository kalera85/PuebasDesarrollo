The _QRCodeReader.swift_ is a simple QRCode Reader/Scanner based on the _AVFoundation_ framework from Apple written in swift. It aims to replace ZXing or ZBar for iOS 8 and over.

It also allows you to switch between the front and the back cameras.

### Installation

#### Manually

[Download](https://github.com/YannickL/QRCodeReader.swift/archive/master.zip) the project and copy the `QRCodeReader` folder into your project to use it in.

## Usage

```swift
// Good practive: create the reader lazily to avoid cpu overload during the
// initialization and each time we need to scan a QRCode
lazy var reader: QRCodeReader = QRCodeReader(cancelButtonTitle: "Cancel")

@IBAction func scanAction(sender: AnyObject) {
  // Retrieve the QRCode content
  // By using the delegate pattern
  reader.delegate = self

  // Or by using the closure pattern
  reader.completionBlock = { (result: String?) in
    println(result)
  }

  // Presents the reader as modal form sheet
  reader.modalPresentationStyle = .FormSheet
  presentViewController(reader, animated: true, completion: nil)
}

// MARK: - QRCodeReader Delegate Methods

func reader(reader: QRCodeReader, didScanResult result: String) {
  self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}

func readerDidCancel(reader: QRCodeReader) {
  self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
```
